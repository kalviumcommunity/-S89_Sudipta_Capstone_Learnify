# TODO Plan for Server Configuration and Updates

## Information Gathered:
- The server runs on port 5000 and uses environment variables for configuration.
- CORS is configured to allow requests from localhost and specific domains.
- Rate limiting is applied to various routes.
- Google OAuth is set up with a callback URL that changes based on the environment.
- A health check endpoint is available.

## Plan:
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file.
   - Validate the presence of `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Review and update the allowed origins in the CORS configuration if necessary.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Adjust rate limits based on the environment (development vs. production).

4. **OAuth Configuration**:
   - Verify the Google OAuth credentials and callback URLs.

5. **Health Check**:
   - Ensure the health check endpoint is functioning correctly.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `.env` (for environment variables)
- `Server/config/index.js` (for configuration updates)

## Follow-up Steps:
- Test the server after making changes to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
- Document any changes made for future reference.
